Weather App - README 

This is a simple weather application that allows users to search for the current weather conditions and a basic hourly forecast for a specific city.

Features
.Users can enter a city name in the search bar.
.Clicking the search button retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
.The app displays the current temperature in Celsius, city name, weather description, and an icon representing the current weather conditions.
.The app displays an hourly forecast for the next 24 hours, including time, temperature, and a weather icon for each 3-hour interval.

Dependencies
.This application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data. An API key is required to use the service. You can obtain a free API key by creating an account on .OpenWeatherMap.
.This code assumes you have an apiKey variable set in the getWeather function with your personal API key.n

Additional Notes
.This is a basic weather application and can be further extended to include features like:
.Displaying weather data in Fahrenheit
.Showing additional weather information like humidity, wind speed, etc.
.Implementing a location search feature to automatically detect the user's location
.This code uses inline styles for simplicity. In a larger project, you would likely want to create a separate CSS file.
